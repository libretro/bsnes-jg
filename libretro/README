bsnes-jg-libretro
-----------------
bsnes-jg is a cycle accurate emulator for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, including support for the Super Game Boy, BS-X
Satellaview, and Sufami Turbo.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. Many changes have been made post-fork:
 - Higher quality resampler with settings
 - Improved performance without loss of accuracy
 - Portability improvements
 - Removal of accuracy-reducing hacks and unnecessary code
 - Significant increase in standards compliance
 - Translation to the C++ Standard Library (ISO C++11)

This is the libretro port of bsnes-jg, whose upstream repository lives at:
https://gitlab.com/jgemu/bsnes

Compiling
---------
  make


Input Devices
-------------
The following input devices are currently supported:

SNES Control Pad
SNES Mouse
Super Multitap
Super Scope
Justifier

Libretro-specific Notes
------------------------
- States created with bsnes-libretro (based on v115) are compatible assuming
  the "accurate" PPU was used, and the coprocessor settings are the same.

Contributing
------------
Contributions to the core emulator should be submitted upstream.
Contributions to the libretro port should be based on the libretro branch.
