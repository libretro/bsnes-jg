bsnes-jg
--------
bsnes-jg (aka BadgerSNES) is an emulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System/Super Famicom, including support for the Super Game Boy, BS-X
Satellaview, and Sufami Turbo.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. All UI code and unneeded support code has been
removed, leaving only the portions required for emulation.

This repository lives at https://gitlab.com/jgemu/bsnes

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

FreeBSD:
  gmake CC=gcc CXX=g++

OpenBSD:
  gmake CC=clang CXX=clang++

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "bsnes/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.

Input Devices
-------------
bsnes-jg uses a game database to determine which input devices must be
plugged in. The following input devices are currently supported:

SNES Control Pad
SNES Mouse
Super Multitap
Super Scope
Justifier

Auxiliary Files
---------------
Super Game Boy ROM images, the BS-X Satellaview BIOS, and the Sufami Turbo
ROM must be loaded as auxiliary files. Sufami Turbo Slot A cartridges must
also be loaded in this manner when loading two Sufami Turbo cartridges.

Settings
--------
aspect_ratio = 0
0 = 8:7, 1 = Auto Region
