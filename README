bsnes-jg
--------
bsnes-jg is an emulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super
Famicom, including support for the Super Game Boy and BS-X Satellaview.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. All UI code and unneeded support code has been
removed, leaving only the portions required for emulation.

The repository lives at https://gitlab.com/jgemu/bsnes
