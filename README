bsnes-jg
--------
bsnes-jg is an emulator for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment
System, including support for the Super Game Boy, BS-X Satellaview, and
Sufami Turbo.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. Many changes have been made post-fork:
 - Higher quality resampler with settings
 - Improved performance without loss of accuracy
 - Removal of hacks
 - Removal of code not required for emulation
 - Translation to standard C++ (ongoing)

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.

Options:
  USE_VENDORED_SAMPLERATE - Set non-zero to use vendored libsamplerate

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

FreeBSD:
  gmake CC=gcc CXX=g++

OpenBSD:
  gmake CC=clang CXX=clang++

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "bsnes/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.

Input Devices
-------------
bsnes-jg uses a game database to determine which input devices must be
plugged in. The following input devices are currently supported:

SNES Control Pad
SNES Mouse
Super Multitap
Super Scope
Justifier

Auxiliary Files
---------------
Super Game Boy ROM images, the BS-X Satellaview BIOS, and the Sufami Turbo
ROM must be loaded as auxiliary files. Sufami Turbo Slot A cartridges must
also be loaded in this manner when loading two Sufami Turbo cartridges.

Settings
--------
aspect_ratio = 0
0 = Auto Region, 1 = 8:7, 2 = NTSC, 3 = PAL

coproc_delaysync = 0
0 = Off, 1 = On

coproc_preferhle = 1
0 = Off, 1 = On

rsqual = 0
0 = Fastest, 1 = Medium, 2 = Best

Notes
-----
- Coprocessor Delayed Sync only applies for LLE coprocessor emulation.
- Firmware is required for LLE coprocessor emulation in some cases.
- Save states created with LLE coprocessor emulation are incompatible with
  states created with HLE coprocessor emulation.
