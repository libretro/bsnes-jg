bsnes-jg
--------
bsnes-jg (aka BadgerSNES) is an emulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System/Super Famicom, including support for the Super Game Boy, BS-X
Satellaview, and Sufami Turbo.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. Many changes have been made post-fork:
 - Higher quality resampler with settings
 - Improved performance (less CPU usage)
 - Removal of hacks
 - Removal of code not required for emulation
 - Translation to standard C++ (ongoing)

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.

Options:
  USE_VENDORED_SAMPLERATE - Set non-zero to use vendored libsamplerate

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

FreeBSD:
  gmake CC=gcc CXX=g++

OpenBSD:
  gmake CC=clang CXX=clang++

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "bsnes/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.

ROM must be loaded as auxiliary files. Sufami Turbo Slot A cartridges must
also be loaded in this manner when loading two Sufami Turbo cartridges.
