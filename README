bsnes-jg
--------
bsnes-jg is a cycle accurate emulator for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, including support for the Super Game Boy, BS-X
Satellaview, and Sufami Turbo.

This is a fork of bsnes v115. Many changes have been made post-fork:
 - Higher quality resampler with settings
 - Improved performance without loss of accuracy
 - Portability improvements
 - Removal of accuracy-reducing hacks and unnecessary code
 - Significant increase in standards compliance
 - Translation to the C++ Standard Library (ISO C++11)

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.

GNU Make's default behaviour for compiling C++ sources is to use g++. If your
platform of choice uses an unpatched GNU Make, you will need to override the
CXX implicit variable if you wish to use a different compiler.

Options:
  DISABLE_MODULE - Set to a non-zero value to disable building the module.
  ENABLE_STATIC_JG - Set to a non-zero value to build a static JG archive.
  USE_VENDORED_SAMPLERATE - Set non-zero to use vendored libsamplerate

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

BSD:
  gmake

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "bsnes/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.

Input Devices
-------------
bsnes-jg uses a game database to determine which input devices must be
plugged in. The following input devices are currently supported:

SNES Control Pad
SNES Mouse
Super Multitap
Super Scope
Justifier

Auxiliary Files
---------------
Super Game Boy ROM images, the BS-X Satellaview BIOS, and the Sufami Turbo
ROM must be loaded as auxiliary files. Sufami Turbo Slot A cartridges must
also be loaded in this manner when loading two Sufami Turbo cartridges.

Settings
--------
aspect_ratio = 0
0 = Auto Region, 1 = 8:7, 2 = NTSC, 3 = PAL

coproc_delaysync = 0
0 = Off, 1 = On

coproc_preferhle = 1
0 = Off, 1 = On

rsqual = 0
0 = Fastest, 1 = Medium, 2 = Best

Notes
-----
- Coprocessor Delayed Sync only applies for LLE coprocessor emulation.
- Firmware is required for LLE coprocessor emulation in some cases.
- Firmware is required for DSP3, ST011, and ST018 in all cases.
- Save states created with LLE coprocessor emulation are incompatible with
  states created with HLE coprocessor emulation.
- The equivalent of the "Accuracy Profile" from previous versions of the
  emulator may be used by setting Coprocessor Delayed Sync and Coprocessor
  HLE off. The defaults are similar to the "Balanced Profile". The "Performance
  Profile" is gone. If this is still too slow, try Mednafen's snes_faust.
